/*
 * This CSS file is for customization purpose only
 *
 * To make it easier to update a YOOtheme template to the latest version use
 * this custom.css file for small CSS modifications.
 *
 * How it works:
 * For example if you want to change a color which is applied in layout.css
 * just copy the original styling into this file right after the commented
 * section. Do this for all CSS modifications.
 *
 * In case you have to update the template save the custom.css file on your computer.
 * De-install and re-install the updated template version. And copy your saved
 * custom.css file back in place. Now compare your modification with the new CSS
 * files and make sure they are working.
 *
 * To activate the loading of this file goto the template folder and take a look
 * at css/template.css.php at the last line. Uncomment follwing line:
 * // include(PATH_ROOT . 'custom.css');
