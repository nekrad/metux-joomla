Languages
---------

It is in the responsibility of the 3rd Party developer to provide the required
translation files but generally there is no limitation in the structure or
information you want to make translatabe. If you translate it in your language
please send me a copy to add it in to tha official package.

In version 2.1 b7 you get spanish, english, german, hungarian, dutch, turkish,
brazilian portuguese, italian and polish languages files. French and Polish too
but incomplete with some texts in english yet.

Please, if you can translate this or make a new language translation send me a
copy to integrate your language into official package!



IMPORTANT!
----------------
- ArtForms uses Joomla's mail settings!!! check if that has been setted
  correctly!
- For make menus you MUST download ArtFormsMenu-j10-2.1.b6-english.zip at
  joomlacode (spanish available also). If not you only can made url links.
- Update-Package is only for update files with a ftp client, then you need go to
  update task and perform updates for your last ArtForms version (make a backup
  before that).
- Added FCKEditor Frontend support (of course you need to have installed it).
- Added Easy Captcha support and fixed bugs with Security Images Component
  support (of course you need to have installed both).
- When you update from old versions please don't forget to perform updates and
  check settings!
! Frontend recived forms was disabled by default, if you need that please check
  settings. If you need to create a menu use URL option and write one of these:
  " /index.php?option=com_artforms&task=ferforms " or
  " /index.php?option=com_artforms&task=tferforms " .
- See changelog.
