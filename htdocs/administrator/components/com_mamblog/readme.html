<h1>Mamblog 1.0</h1>

<p>Mamblog is a user blog system for Joomla! It allows you to run a page where users can register and get their own blog page where they can add new blog entries without having to be editors.</p>

<p>The component is still in beta but will be released in a stable version once it has been tested enough. Many people are using this component already though, so it should be quite stable enough for most needs.</p>

<p>Among the features are: Users can publish/unpublish/archive individual blog entries, set appearence attributes. No new or changed tables in Joomla!, it makes use of the standard Joomla! content sections. Admin can edit/delete all blogs from the administrator interface. Lots of configure options. Completely automatical installation. Several language files included: English, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, German (informal), Italian, Russian, Spanish, French.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Mamblog is a component for Mambo 4.5.2.3 and Joomla 1.0.x<br />
Mamblog requires PHP4 or above.</p>


<h2>License</h2>
<p>Mamblog is released under the GNU General Public License, a copy of this license should be included in the zip file and available for reading from the administrator page once the component has been installed.</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Just install the component as according to the Joomla! documentation, a menu item for the component will be created and published automatically. This means users of your site can start using the blog component as soon as you've installed the component.</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once installed you will have a new menu option called Mamblog under the Components menu in the administrator page of Joomla!. From this menu you can administer the component, read information, change the configuration etc.</p>

<h3>How to link to specific blogs</h3>
<p>You can reach the blogs of certain users by either of the following URL:s:<br />
<pre>
http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_mamblog&task=show&action=user&id=89
http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_mamblog&task=show&action=user&id=Username
</pre>
Either use user id or username to link to a user.</p>

<h3>How to link to the users own blog</h3>
<p>The stable version of Mamblog 1.0 adds a user menu link to the users' own blog. If you don't want to re-install the component you can add this function yourself by adding the following as an url menu item:</p>
<pre>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_mamblog&task=show&action=showmyblog</pre>
<p>They can also get a link to their own archive, it is very similar and looks like this:</p>
<pre>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_mamblog&task=show&action=showmyarchive</pre>

<h4>Important information on the Mamblog section</h4>
<p>If name of the Mamblog section has been changed the blog entries won't be automatically removed if you delete the component. Don't add any categories either, it is unnecessary and might cause problems.</p>

<h3>Write a blog entry</h3>
<p>When Mamblog is installed a new entry called "Write a blog entry" is automatically added to your user menu and this is what users click on to add new entries. You can add this link anywhere on your site if you want, it looks like this:</p>
<pre>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_mamblog&task=edit</pre>


<h3>Comment system support</h3>
<p>To allow comments to blog entries you first have to install a separate comment system. Mamblog supports both AkoComment by Arthur Konze and the now obsolete ComboLITE/ComboMAX components by Phil Taylor.</p>

<h4>AkoComment</h4>
<p>Arthur Konze has created a very nice and feature rich comment component called AkoComment which is available at <a href="http://www.mamboportal.com/" target="_new">Mamboportal.com</a>. After you have downloaded and installed AkoComment you need to set the "Main Operating Mode" in the AkoComment Settings to "Choose from settings below" and select your Mamblog section from the available sections. You will also have to change the Mamblog configuration setting "Comment system to use" under Settings to "AkoComment" to enable the comments in Mamblog. Also make sure that you allow comments to blog entries, either by setting "Allow Comments" under Default Values, or "Let users set if comments are allowed?" under Settings, to "Yes".</p>

<h4>ComboLITE/ComboMAX</h4>
<p>These components are now unavailable but are still supported for those who already have it installed. When you have installed ComboLITE/ComboMAX you will have to change the configuration setting "Comment system to use" to "ComboLITE or ComboMAX" and make sure that the Default value is to allow comments, or that users can set if they want comments allowed. <em>Note that this has not been tested recently since these components have been discontinued by the author.</em></p>

<h4>Joomlaboard</h4>
<p>If you want to use the Joomlaboard forum as a commenting system you must choose this option and also add the id of the forum comment threads will be created in in the Joomlaboard forum ID config option below.</p>

<h3>Moderating blog entries</h3>
All blog entries will show up in the content section called Mamblog and can be listed and edited just as normal content. New blog entries should be added through the frontend though.<br />

<h3>Listing Bloggers</h3>
<p>Mamblog doesn't have any internal functionality to list bloggers, but you can use the excellent <a href="http://mosforge.net/projects/userlistxtd">Userlist XTD</a> component by Bernhard Zechmann which has support for Mamblog.</p>
